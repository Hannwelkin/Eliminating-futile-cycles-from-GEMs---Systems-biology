# Eliminating redox futile cycles from Genome-scale metabolic models
This project aimed to eliminate redox futile cycles from genome-scale metabolic networks. The bounded model prediction was compared to the wild type model and for validation we used laboratory reported data of 3 experimental analysis.
The model was tested on both LB and M9 cultures for different parameters such as growth rate, oxygene consumption, glucose consumption rate, acetate production rate and recombinant metabolites such as lycopene production.
